    """
    Function: Checks both live pending orders AND open positions (LIMIT, STOP, and MARKET)
    and adjusts their take profit levels based on the NEAREST MATCHING strategy risk-reward ratio.
    
    INTELLIGENT APPROACH:
    1. Calculate current R:R from order's exit/target prices
    2. Compare with strategy-specific R:R values from accountmanagement.json
    3. Find the nearest matching R:R (next higher value) and use that
    4. Fall back to default selected_risk_reward if no match found
    
    Args:
        inv_id: Optional specific investor ID to process. If None, processes all investors.
        
    Returns:
        dict: Statistics about the processing
