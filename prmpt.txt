Execute ordersstatus() only in Africa/Lagos timezone using current datetime.
Set AGE_LIMIT as a human-readable string like "5 days old" to define minimum order age.
Set CHOSEN_BUY_MODE to either "lowest" or "highest" to pick buy limit price.
Set CHOSEN_SELL_MODE to either "highest" or "lowest" to pick sell limit price.
Reject execution if CHOSEN_BUY_MODE or CHOSEN_SELL_MODE is invalid.
Convert AGE_LIMIT string into total minutes (supporting minutes, hours, days, weeks).
Default to 7200 minutes (5 days) if AGE_LIMIT parsing fails or is empty.
Scan all directories recursively to find every "alltimeframeslimitorders.json" file.
Skip processing folders named in GLOBAL_SKIP set.
For each symbol, load its JSON and extract market name and oldest age across timeframes.
Compare oldest age in minutes against AGE_LIMIT; mark as old enough if greater or equal.
Flatten all orders from all timeframes into a single list.
Identify single_buy and single_sell orders if flagged.
Collect all buy_limit and sell_limit orders separately.
Choose buy price: single_buy first, else lowest or highest entry_price based on CHOSEN_BUY_MODE.
Choose sell price: single_sell first, else highest or lowest entry_price based on CHOSEN_SELL_MODE.
Determine order status: pending (no entry), win (TP hit), lost (SL hit), running (entry hit, no TP/SL).
Classify symbol into one of three global categories — no overlap allowed:
→ If any chosen buy or sell is running → classify as RUNNING.
→ Else if both or one side pending AND age < AGE_LIMIT → classify as PENDING_YOUNG.
→ Else (aged enough OR completed) → classify as FREE.
Record reason for each classification.
For FREE symbols: include chosen buy/sell limits and reason.
For RUNNING: include both limits, statuses, and age.
For PENDING_YOUNG: include limits, age, and reason.
Save per-symbol JSON ("allnotimeframesorders.json") in same folder with classification result.
Aggregate all FREE orders into one global file per broker.
Aggregate all RUNNING orders into one global file per broker.
Aggregate all PENDING_YOUNG orders into one global file per broker.
Detect broker name from path structure (first matching known broker folder).
Create global files inside broker’s symbols directory.
Track two history modes separately:
→ Mode 1: BUY=lowest, SELL=highest → save to highselllowbuy_history.json
→ Mode 2: BUY=highest, SELL=lowest → save to lowsellhighbuy_history.json
In history, record every order (all timeframes) with: market, type, entry, SL, TP, status, single flag, timestamp.
In history summary: count running, profit, stoploss, pending.
Print real-time logs with timestamps, actions, and final counts.
Ensure perfect separation: no running orders in free list, no old orders in young pending.
End with summary: FREE count, RUNNING count, PENDING_YOUNG count.
Print final confirmation: "PERFECT SEPARATION. DONE."
